USER:What is the sharing rule limit?
EXPERT:EXPERT: The sharing rule limit is the maximum number of sharing rules that can be created for an object. The default limit is 300, but it can be increased to a maximum of 500 through a Salesforce support case.
USER:What is the sharing rule limit?
EXPERT:Use sharing rules to extend sharing access to users in public groups, roles, or territories. Sharing rules give particular users greater access by making automatic exceptions to your org-wide sharing settings. Like role hierarchies, a sharing rule can never be stricter than your org-wide default settings. It simply allows greater access for particular users. You can base a sharing rule on record ownership or other criteria. After you select which records to share, you define which groups or users to extend access to and what level of access they have. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_about_sharing_rules.htm&type=5 There are two types of sharing rules limits per entity (per object). They are as follows: A general sharing rules limit which counts for all sharing rules, including criteria-based. The default limit is 300 and can be increased to a maximum of 500 through a Support case. A separate criteria-based sharing rules limit. The default limit is 50 and can be increased to a maximum of 200 through a Support case. Note: Too many sharing rules can slow down insert and updates. As a best practice, please review the organization's sharing rules to determine if an increase is necessary. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000321647&type=1
